## Fetch user from token

Optional:
If you're up for an extra challenge, try allowing specific user tokens through and create a query to return the current user for the token

### Notes
- TODO: Code refactoring
  - AuthTokenCache convert from GenServer to Agent?
- Tests must be written for the GQL part
- Should we also write tests for the auth tokens cache?
