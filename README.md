## TODO:
  - [ ] Web API Speedup
  - [ ] Distributed Request Counter
  - [ ] Caching Telemetry
  - [ ] Testing: Make sure we have testing for our new caching systems

  - **Optional**: For extra credit you can try implementing a Singleton Cache that would be accessed in a distributed environment (meaning one node has the data and the rest pull it from that node, think about how you select which node holds the data), use this for the Distributed Request Counter

### Notes
